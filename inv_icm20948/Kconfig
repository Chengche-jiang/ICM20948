	  Say yes here to build support for the Invensense ICM-20948 
	  9-axis IMU (3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis magnetometer).

	  The ICM-20948 is a System in Package (SiP) that combines a 3-axis
	  gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, and an AK09916 3-axis magnetometer.
	  
	  This driver supports both I2C and SPI communication interfaces.
	  
	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module for the
	  core will be called inv_icm20948.

	tristate "Invensense ICM-20948 I2C Interface"
	depends on INV_ICM20948 && I2C
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for I2C interface for Invensense ICM-20948
	  IMU sensors.
	  
	  This provides the I2C bus interface for the Invensense ICM-20948 IMU 
	  driver.
	  
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called inv_icm20948_i2c.

	tristate "Invensense ICM-20948 SPI Interface"
	depends on INV_ICM20948 && SPI_MASTER
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for SPI interface for Invensense ICM-20948
	  IMU sensors.
	  
	  This provides the SPI bus interface for the Invensense ICM-20948 IMU 
	  driver.
	  
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called inv_icm20948_spi.

	help
	  Say Y here to include support for the AK09916 magnetometer
	  integrated in the Invensense ICM-20948 IMU.
	  
	  The AK09916 is a 3-axis electronic magnetometer that can
	  measure terrestrial magnetism in the range of ±4900μT.
	  
	  If unsure, say Y.

config INV_ICM20948_TEMPERATURE
	bool "Invensense ICM-20948 Temperature Sensor Support"
	depends on INV_ICM20948
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for the temperature sensor
	  integrated in the Invensense ICM-20948 IMU.
	  
	  The temperature sensor can be used for temperature compensation
	  of sensor readings.
	  
	  If unsure, say Y.

config INV_ICM20948_DEBUG
	bool "Enable debug features for Invensense ICM-20948"
	depends on INV_ICM20948
	help
	  Say Y here to enable debug features in the Invensense ICM-20948
	  driver.
	  
	  This enables additional sysfs entries and debugfs files for
	  advanced debugging, including register access and firmware features.
	  
	  If unsure, say N.
